# Cardano Go PBL

## Course Purpose

Learn Cardano development using Go and the Blink Labs toolchain. Build applications that interact with the Cardano blockchain using gOuroboros for node communication, Apollo for transaction building, Adder for chain indexing, and Bursa for wallet management.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, learners will be able to:

1. Connect to Cardano nodes using gOuroboros
2. Build and submit transactions using Apollo
3. Index blockchain events using Adder
4. Manage wallets programmatically with Bursa
5. Interact with smart contracts from Go applications
6. Debug cross-stack blockchain applications

- **099.3**: I can build a command-line tool with multiple commands using the Cobra library.
- **099.4**: I can create a web API that handles requests and sends responses using Fiber in Go.

### Module 100: Prerequisites + Tools of Cardano Go Development

Background knowledge about Cardano development for Go developers.

- **100.1**: I can describe what Cardano is, how its blockchain differs from others, and what kinds of applications can be built on it.
- **100.2**: I can explain how Ouroboros reaches consensus and why that matters for building on Cardano.
- **100.3**: I can explain why Bursa was built and what problems it solves.
- **100.4**: I can explain why Apollo was built and what problems it solves.
- **100.5**: I can explain why Adder was built and what problems it solves.
- **100.6**: I can explain why Cardano Up was built and what problems it solves.
- **100.7**: I can navigate the course structure and set up my development environment for the modules ahead.

### Module 101: Interacting with the Cardano Node

Options for accessing a Cardano Node and basic operations.

- **101.1**: I can set up and run the gOuroboros Starter Kit to connect to a Cardano Node.
- **101.2**: I can fetch specific blocks from a remote Cardano Node.
- **101.3**: I can check how far a Cardano Node has synced with the blockchain.
- **101.4**: I can fetch information about pending transactions waiting in a Node's mempool.

### Module 102: Building Simple Transactions

Essentials of transaction building with Apollo.

- **102.1**: I can create a wallet with Bursa.
- **102.2**: I can build a simple transaction with Apollo.
- **102.3**: I can sign a transaction manually and programmatically.
- **102.4**: I can submit a transaction to a node with gOuroboros.
- **102.5**: I can set a time window that controls when a transaction is valid.
- **102.6**: I can add simple metadata to a transaction.

### Module 201: Reacting to Chain Events

Monitor blockchain activity by watching the chain and filtering events.

- **201.1**: I can set up and run the Adder Starter Kit to watch blockchain events.
- **201.2**: I can configure Adder to connect to a Cardano Node.
- **201.3**: I can use Adder to filter blockchain events by type, address, policy, or stake pool.

### Module 202: Querying the Blockchain

View global or historical blockchain data beyond event handling.

- **202.1**: I can explain what a blockchain indexer does and evaluate trade-offs for using one in my application.
- **202.2**: I can identify when an event handler isn't enough and choose a query-based approach instead.
- **202.3**: I can store and retrieve data using Adder.
- **202.4**: I can select the right query provider for my application.
- **202.5**: I can combine live event data with historical query data to build a more complete picture of blockchain activity.

### Module 203: Applications and Smart Contracts

Build transactions that interact with smart contracts.

- **203.1**: I can trace how a type defined in Aiken appears in a blueprint file and in Go code.
- **203.2**: I can build a transaction that mints or burns tokens using a native script (no smart contract required).
- **203.3**: I can build a transaction that mints or burns tokens using a validator script (smart contract).
- **203.4**: I can build a transaction that unlocks tokens held by a smart contract.
- **203.5**: I can build a transaction that attaches data to a new output on the blockchain.
- **203.6**: I can build a transaction that passes input data to a smart contract using a redeemer.

### Module 204: Serializing Data

Understand how data is stored on the blockchain.

- **204.1**: I can extract smart contract data (datums and redeemers) from Cardano's binary format (CBOR).
- **204.2**: I can compile a smart contract that accepts parameters at deployment time.
- **204.3**: I can read a blockchain event and identify the smart contract interaction inside it.
- **204.4**: I can modify decoded CBOR data structures in Go and re-encode them for use in transactions.
- **204.5**: I can read a protobuf spec and use it to interpret how data is structured in a system.
- **204.6**: I can use the CDDL specification as a reference to understand the structure of Cardano transaction data.

### Module 301: Debugging

What to do when none of the above actually works.

- **301.1**: I can diagnose and fix bugs that span blockchain interactions, not just Go code.
- **301.2**: I can use Go's profiling and debugging tools to diagnose performance and runtime issues.
- **301.3**: I can identify the right community resources, documentation, and support channels for troubleshooting Cardano Go development.

### Module 302: Contributing

- **302.1**: I can make a PR to a Blink Labs repository.
