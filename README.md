# README for Cardano Go course development

This repository houses the work for a **Project Catalyst–funded collaboration** between **Gimbal Labs** and **Blink Labs** to update and expand the *Cardano Go* course. The course teaches **Cardano development using Go tooling**, including Bursa, Apollo, Adder, and other tools created by Blink Labs.

## Project Scope

This project covers the full lifecycle of updating the Cardano Go curriculum and onboarding developers into real-world Cardano tooling. Work is organized into three phases and managed transparently here on GitHub.

## Phases

* **Phase 0: Audit** – Review existing modules and plan required updates.
* **Phase 1: Course Update** – Streamline lessons, integrate new examples, and prepare the updated course for release.
* **Phase 2: CLI Development** – Support developers as they complete the course and contribute to the funded DNS CLI project.
